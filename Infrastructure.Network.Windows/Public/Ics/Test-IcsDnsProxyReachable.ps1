# Test-IcsDnsProxyReachable
#   Preflight check 7: the exact DNS path the VM is about to use -
#   libc -> systemd-resolved stub -> ICS DNS proxy (LAN-side
#   vEthernet IP) -> host's WiFi DNS. Probes against
#   archive.ubuntu.com because the package the seed needs (dnsmasq)
#   resolves there; success means cloud-init's apt phase has a
#   working name service before we even create the VM.
#
#   Auto-repair on probe FAIL is bounded to a SINGLE Reset-IcsSharing
#   attempt + one re-probe. If the re-probe also fails it is a
#   genuine ICS bug, not a transient state flap; the operator gets
#   one clear FAIL with the next steps in Detail, not a retry
#   spiral. Returns a finding object; orchestrator routes to
#   Add-Finding.
#
#   ICS's DNS proxy is known to enter a broken state where it
#   answers UDP/53 with TCP RSTs (host-side Resolve-DnsName -Server
#   192.168.137.1 returns "An existing connection was forcibly
#   closed"). Restart-Service SharedAccess does NOT recover from
#   this; the canonical fix is to toggle the WiFi adapter's Sharing
#   checkbox off + on, which Reset-IcsSharing automates via the
#   HNetCfg COM API.
